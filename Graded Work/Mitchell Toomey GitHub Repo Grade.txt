Mitchell Toomey EDRM 718 GitHub Repo

This is a very well designed repo with a folder for data files, notebooks, and
instructor notes. The only change needed is to put all non-essential and
non-text files into your .gitignore. I recommend adding these lines:

*.html
*.Rhistory
*.DS_Store
*.RData

Nice work!
