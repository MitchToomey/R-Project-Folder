#### Reasons I enrolled in This Course

I have quite a bit of experience in research roles working with SPSS. However, from talking to other researchers using R, I figure it will be much more useful, and practical, to learn R for analyzing data. I want to become a tenure-track assistant professor when I graduate, and believe knowing R will help me be more efficient in with my research productivity.

#### Previous Experience with R

I have zero previous experience with R, but lots with SPSS. So, basically, I understand some data analyses, but I feel like learning R will really allow me to dive deeper into my understanding of data.

#### How I Plan to Use R Once I Finish This Course

For everything! One of your videos said R can analyze single-case data, which is the design I plan to use for my dissertation next year. I want to use it as a professor in a counselor education program upon graduation. And I want to become more proficient in creating all the pretty reports and tables that you showed in your tutorial videos!

#### How Deep I want to Dive with R

I want to say "very deep," but I know my school schedule will only allow me to dive only so deep. I am interested in learning all that you have to offer this semester. I will even try to find time to use R for existing datasets I have access to through my research team for extra practice. R is going to be one of those things that I really just need to practice using consistently to deepen my knowledge.
